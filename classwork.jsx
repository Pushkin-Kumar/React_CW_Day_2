      The aim is not to take you from "beginner" to "expert" but to take you
      from "beginner" to "comfortable." From there, you should be able to start
      making your way, learning from <a href=""> the rest of MDN</a>, and other

      If you are a complete beginner, web development can be challenging â€” we
      will hold your hand and provide enough detail for you to feel comfortable
      and learn the topics properly. You should feel at home whether you are a
      student learning web development (on your own or as part of a class), a
      teacher looking for class materials, a hobbyist, or someone who just wants
      to understand more about how web technologies work.
